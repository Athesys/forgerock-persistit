<h1>Launching AdminUI Remotely</h1>
<p>If your Persistit-based application is running on a headless server,
  or on a computer in an inconvenient location, you can launch AdminUI
  on another workstation and access the server remotely.
</p>
<p>To do this, you must first enable Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
  support for the remote Management server within Persistit.
  Then launch AdminUI and connect it to the running Persistit instance.
</p>
<p>To enable remote access, specify one (not both) of the following
  property values in the Persistit configuration file
</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr><td></td><td><span class="code">rmiport=</span><span class="code-italic">portNumber</span></td><td>(typically 1099)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>or</td><td><span class="code">rmihost=</span><span class="code-italic">rmiRegistryUrl</span></td><td>(URL of an external RMI registry)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Alternatively, you can also specify either of these on the command line as
</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><span class="code">-Dcom.persistit.rmiport=<i>
        rmiPort</i></span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>or</td>
    <td><span class="code">-Dcom.persistit.rmihost=<i>
     rmiRegistryUrl</i></span>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
To launch the AdminUI utility on a workstation, execute the command line
</p>
<p><span class="code">java -jar persistit_jsa100_ui.jar
  </span><span class="code-italic">host:port</span>
</p>
<p>where <i>host</i> and <i>port</i>
  are the hostname and port for the RMI registry. If you specified the
  <span class="code">rmiport</span> property for the server, then
  <i>host</i> is simply the hostname of that server,
  and port is the <i>port</i> number you specified.
  (The default value is RMI's well-known port address of 1099.)
</p>
<p>If you specify a hostname and port on the command line, AdminUI 
  automatically connects to the Persistit Management interface registered there.
  If you don't specify a hostname, or if you want to connect to a
  different server, select <i>File-&gt;Connect</i> 
  from the menu to specify the host server.
