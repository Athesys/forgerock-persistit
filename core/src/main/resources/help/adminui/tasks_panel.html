<h1>Tasks Panel</h1>
<p>Tasks are utility functions that may take a significant amount of time
  to complete. Currently Persistit offers three task types:
</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <p><b>Check database integrity</b>
      </p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>Invokes the <span class="code">com.persistit.IntegrityCheck</span>
        class to verify the structural integrity of one or more trees
        and/or volumes.
        <br>
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <p><b>Save data to file</b>
      </p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>Invokes the <span class="code">com.persistit.StreamSaver</span>
        class to export data from one or more trees or volumes to a file.
        <br>
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <p><b>Load data from file</b>
      </p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>Invokes the <span class="code">com.persistit.StreamLoader</span>
        class to import data from a file previously written by a Save
        operation.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To start one of these tasks, select the <span class="italic">New Task</span>
  button or menu item, fill in the parameter form and click
  <span class="italic">Okay</span>. The task will be started and a line
  item added to the Tasks table pane of the Tasks Panel.

<table border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <b>Section</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      <b>Description &amp; Use</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <b>A</b>
    </td>
    <td>
        The Tasks table contains one row for every task that has ever
        been started in the current Persistit instance (unless that Task
        was subsequently removed). The task list is managed by the
        Persistit instance itself, not AdminUI. If you disconnect and
        later reconnect AdminUI, any previously started tasks will be
        shown. Select a row of the Tasks table to see detailed progress
        information and results of that task.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <b>B</b>
    </td>
    <td>
        The Task Detail pane shows detailed information about the
        selected task, including its name, description, owner (specified
        when the task was created), status, and message log.
      <p>The <span class="code">State</span> field indicates one of the
        following states:
      </p>
      <table border="0">
      <tr>
      <td><em>Running</em></td><td>the task is still running</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><em>Suspended</em></td><td>execution has been suspended (click Resume to
        let it continue)</td>
      </td>
      <tr>
      <td><em>Done</em></td><td>task finished normally</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><em>Failed</em></td><td>task failed. The reason may be shown in the
        <span class="italic">Exception</span> message.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><em>Ended</em></td><td>task was stopped manually.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><em>Expired</em></td><td>task was stopped because it ran longer than its
        timeout interval.</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The <span class="italic">Status</span> area displays a
        task-specific message indicating the task's overall progress.
      </p>
      <p>The <span class="italic">Log</span> area displays any log output
        generated by the task. For example, the <span class="italic">Check
        database integrity</span> tasks writes its results to this area.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
