<h1>Buffers Panel</h1>
<p>The Buffers Panel is divided into the following three sections:</p>
<table>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <b>Section</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      <b>Description &amp; Use</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <b>A</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      Summary table, one row per buffer pool. Persistit supports
      multiple buffer pools different buffer sizes. In this example,
      the default configuration containing a single pool of 8K buffers
      is shown.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <b>B</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      Buffer detail table, one row per buffer. In this example, the
      rows are sorted by decreasing order of the number of changes made
      to the buffer. Click on a column header to toggle the ordering of
      rows by values in that column between Ascending, Descending and Unsorted
      order.  
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <b>C</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      Buffer selection panel: This panel of toggle buttons affects the
      collection of buffers shown in the buffer detail table. The
      buttons select:
      <table border="0">
        <tr><td><b>Button</b></td><td><b>Selects</b></td></tr>
        <tr><td><em>Valid</em></td><td>Buffers that contain valid data</td></tr>
        <tr><td><em>Dirty</em></td><td>buffers that contain modified data that has not yet been
        written to the database</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>Reader</em></td><td>buffers that are currently being read by one or more
        threads and are therefore locked non-exclusively</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>Writer</em></td><td>buffers that are currently being updated by a thread,
        and are therefore locked exclusively</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>Selecting multiple buttons displays the union of all the buffers
        selected by each individual button. In other words, the selected
        button are OR'ed together. Deselecting all buttons displays all
        buffers in the buffer pool.
      </p>
