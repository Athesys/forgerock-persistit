<h1>AdminUI: The Administrative Utility Interface for Persistit</h1>
<p>AdminUI lets you examine and manage an instance of Persistit running
  within an application. With it you can view:
</p>
<ul class="L1">
  <li>
  <p>Application data stored in Persistit,
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Configuration details, including physical file names, sizes and
    growth parameters,
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>License information,
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Performance statistics, including buffer pool and prewrite journal
    utilization.
  </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, AdminUI lets you launch various utility tasks such as
  exporting and importing data.
</p>
<p>AdminUI uses the Java Swing interface and requires a workstation with
  keyboard, mouse and display.
</p>
<p>You can <a href="launch_locally.html">launch AdminUI locally</a> 
  within the same JVM as the Persistit instance.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, if Persistit is configured for remote
  management, you can connect AdminUI from a
  <a href="launch_remotely.html">remote workstation</a>.
