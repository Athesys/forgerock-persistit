Implements Persistit&trade;'s core functionality.
</p>
<p>
Applications initialize and close Persistit using the static 
{@link com.persistit.Persistit#initialize initialize} and 
{@link com.persistit.Persistit#close close} methods of
{@link com.persistit.Persistit}.
</p>
<p>
Applications interact with Persistit through instances of {@link com.persistit.Exchange}.
An <tt>Exchange</tt> has two important associated member objects, a {@link com.persistit.Key}
and a {@link com.persistit.Value}. A <tt>Key</tt> is a mutable representation of a
key, and a <tt>Value</tt> is a mutable representation of a value.  Applications
manipulate these objects and interact with the database through one of the following
four general patterns:
</p>
<ol>
<li> 
Modify the <tt>Key</tt>, perform a {@link com.persistit.Exchange#fetch fetch} 
operation, and query the <tt>Value</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Modify the <tt>Key</tt>, modify the <tt>Value</tt>, and then perform a
{@link com.persistit.Exchange#store store} operation to insert or replace data
in the database.
</li>
<li>
Modify the <tt>Key</tt>, and then perform a 
{@link com.persistit.Exchange#remove remove} to remove one or more key/value pairs.
</li>
<li>
Optionally modify the <tt>Key</tt>, perform a 
{@link com.persistit.Exchange#traverse traverse} operation, then query the 
resulting state of <tt>Key</tt> and/or <tt>Value</tt> to enumerate key/value pairs
currently stored in the database.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Additional methods of <tt>Exchange</tt> include 
{@link com.persistit.Exchange#fetchAndStore fetchAndStore}
and {@link com.persistit.Exchange#fetchAndRemove fetchAndRemove}.  
These atomically modify the database
and return the former value associated with the <tt>Key</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Every <tt>Exchange</tt> has an associated {@link com.persistit.Transaction
Transaction} object that represents its current transactional state.  Every 
operation performed by any of the access or update methods of the 
<tt>Exchange</tt> is performed within the context of this <tt>Transaction</tt>, 
meaning that its result is atomic, consistent, isolated and durable (the ACID properties).  
By default these mthods behave as if the bounded by {@link com.persistit.Transaction#begin begin}
{@link com.persistit.Transaction#commit commit} and
{@link com.persistit.Transaction#end end} calls on the <tt>Transaction</tt>.
An application can group multiple operations together by explicitly invoking
<tt>begin</tt>, <tt>commit</tt> and <tt>end</tt> calls.  See 
{@link com.persistit.Transaction} for further information.
</p>
<p>
The Persistit database is stored in physical files managed by {@link com.persistit.Volume Volume}s.
A <tt>Volume</tt> contains an unbounded number of logical {@link com.persistit.Tree Tree}s, each
of which constitutes a physical balanced tree.
</p>
<p>
{@link com.persistit.IntegrityCheck IntegrityCheck} provides a simple mechanism to verify
the internal integrity of <tt>Volume</tt>s and/or individual <tt>Tree</tt>s.
</p>
<p>
This package also includes {@link com.persistit.PersistitMap PersistitMap} and
{@link com.persistit.PersistitIndexedSet}.  <tt>PersistitMap</tt>
provides a persistent, fast implementation of <tt>java.util.SortedMap</tt>.
<tt>PersistitIndexedSet</tt> associates objects with unique persistent object identitifiers.
To be useful in a <tt>PersistitIndexedSet</tt>, an object must be encodable as a key, meaning
either that it is one of the classes for which built-in key encoding is supported (such as
<tt>java.lang.String</tt>) or it has a registered {@link com.persistit.encoding.KeyCoder}.
</p>
<p>
Finally, an application can obtain an instance of a 
{@link com.persistit.Management} object that exposes an API 
for measuring performance data, sizes and utilization
of database volumes, and many other elements from the
{@link com.persistit.Persistit#getManagement} method.  Optionally this class
can be exported via Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) to permit administration
from a connected workstation.
