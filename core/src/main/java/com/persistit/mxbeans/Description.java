 * This annotation is intended to work somewhat like the Description annotation
 * specified in JMX 2 (JSR 255) which is currently inactive. The annotation lets
 * you add a description to the Descriptor attribute of an MBeanFeatureInfo.
 * Unfortunately that does not directly affect the result returned by
 * {@link javax.management.MBeanFeatureInfo#getDescription()} but that can be
 * accomplished through the MXBeanWrapper class which marshals the value from
 * the Descriptor to the description attribute.
