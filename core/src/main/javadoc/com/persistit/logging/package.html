<p>
Implements Persistit&trade;'s logging mechanism and provides a simple method 
for connecting Persistit's log output to the embedding application.
The default logger writes log messages to the file <tt>persistit.log</tt> and
overwrites that file each time Persistit is initialized.
</p>
<p>
To override the default logger, for example, to route Persistit's log
messages to the embedding application's logging subsystem, implement a subclass of
{@link com.persistit.logging.AbstractPersistitLogger AbstractPersistitLogger}
and install it with the static 
{@link com.persistit.Persistit#setPersistitLogger setPersistitLogger} 
method of <tt>Persistit</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Also see the 
{@link com.persistit.logging.JDK14LoggingAdapter},
{@link com.persistit.logging.Log4JAdapter} and
{@link com.persistit.logging.ApacheCommonsLogAdapter} 
classes, which wrap a JDK 1.4
<tt>java.util.logging.Logger</tt>,
<tt>org.apache.log4j.Logger</tt>, and 
<tt>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</tt>,
respectively.
