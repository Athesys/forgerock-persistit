Provides an interface and abstract superclasses for classes used to break object
reference graphs for serialization.
</p>
<p>
The general problem this interface is intended to solve is to reduce or
control the scope of serialization of an object.  In a typical application
some object A may need to refer to some other object B that has a large
graph of connected objects.  Using Java's standard serialization mechanism,
serializing A also serializes B and all the objects it references.
This set may be very large, and further, it may be semantically incorrect
to serialize the state of B with A because the state of B may change
independently of A, so in many cases B's state should not be serialized
concurrently with A's state.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider a <tt>PurchaseOrder</tt> class that identifies a 
<tt>Supplier</tt> in one of its fields.  Assume further that the Supplier 
refers to a large, mostly static, catalog of Products.  A naive implementation
might be written as follows:
<blockquote><pre>
class PurchaseOrder
{
	...
	private Date date;
	private Supplier supplier;
	...
	
	public Supplier getSupplier()
	{
		return supplier;
	}
	
	public void setSuppler(Object suppler)
	{
		this.supplier = supplier;
	}
}
</pre></blockquote>
In this implementation, standard Java serialization would serialize not only
the state of a <tt>PurchaseOrder</tt>, but also the entire state of the referenced
<tt>Supplier</tt>.
</p>
<p>
To break this connection, the <tt>PurchaseOrder</tt> class could be
rewritten as follows:
<blockquote><pre>
class PurchaseOrder
{
	...
	private Date date;
	private SupplierReference supplier;
	...
	
	public Supplier getSupplier()
	{
		return (Supplier)supplier.get();
	}
	
	public void setSuppler(Object supplier)
	{
		Object id = &lt;code to derive the supplier's permanent id&gt;;
		this.supplier = new SupplierReference(id, supplier);
	}
}

class SupplierReference extends AbstractReference
{
	public Object lookup(object supplierId)
	{
		Supplier supplier = &lt;code to retrieve the Supplier given its identity&gt;;
		return supplier;
	}
}
</pre></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Two abstract implementation classes are provided: 
{@link com.persistit.ref.AbstractReference} and 
{@link com.persistit.ref.AbstractWeakReference}.  For both of these the 
{@link com.persistit.ref.AbstractReference#lookup} method must be implemented to 
peform the application-specific actions necessary to recover and instantiate a 
persistent object given its persistent identifier.  The difference between the two
classes is that once the referent object has been instantiated, the 
<tt>AbstractReference</tt> implementation holds a strong reference 
to it, while the <tt>AbstractWeakReference</tt> holds a weak reference.
A weak reference allows the garbage collector to remove and reclaim
the memory occupied by the referent object.  A subsequent call to the
<tt>AbstractWeakReference</tt>'s <tt>get</tt> method simply instantiates 
a new copy of the referent object.
