# This is a working template for a simple script to perform crash
# recovery testing in Persistit.  This script should be run from the
# root directory of the Persistit project. As configured, this
# script runs the recovery_1.plan stress test for 60 seconds, 
# kills the JVM and then runs the recovery_2.plan to verify
# consistency.
