/**
 * <p>
 * Inspired by bug1126297: Assertion failure in
 * TransactionIndexBucket#allocateTransactionStatus
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The symptom was the bug (a locked TransactionStatus on the free list) but the
 * cause was mishandling of abandoned transactions from the
 * {@link Persistit#cleanup()} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When attempting to rollback the abandoned transaction, the status was
 * notified and then unlocked. Since the lock was held by a now dead thread, an
 * IllegalMonitorStateException occurred. It was then put on the free list
 * during the next cleanup of that bucket since it had been notified.
 * </p>
