/**
 * TableStatusRecoveryIT and RenameTableIT fail intermittently
 * 
 * These two tests have been failing intermittently since the new MVCC code came
 * in. I'm going to mark them as @Ignore to unblock other merges, but we have to
 * fix them before we can release MVCC into the wild.
 * 
 * Since the failure is intermittent, I recommend several runs of both of these
 * tests, on various machines including the AMIs, before we mark this as
 * fix-released. We should also un-ignore those two tests.
 * 
 * The intermittent failure in RenameTableIT may or may not be related to bug
 * 852142. We should treat the two bugs as separate for now, since that other
 * bug was observed only once before (and this one is now fairly frequent).
 * 
 * 
 * =====
 * 
 * This test looks for possible mechanism. Persistit#initialize(Properties)
 * starts the CheckpointManager's polling thread before applying transactions.
 * The setting of the initial timestamp for new transactions is updated _while_
 * transactions are being applied. This provides an opportunity for the
 * checkpoint transaction to have the same start timestamp or commit timestamp
 * as one of the transactions being recovered.
 * 
 * This can lead to two effects, both of which have been observed:
 * 
 * - recovery can issue an error message saying that a transaction already
 * exists having the same start timestamp
 * 
 * - A previously committed transactions can fail to be recovered.
 *
