 * <p>
 * An abstract superclass for implementations of {@link PersistitReference} that
 * implement weak reference semantics. A concrete subclass implements the
 * method: <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *      public Object lookup(Object id)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote> which should return the Object associated with the supplied id,
 * or <code>null</code> if there is none. The meaning of the identifier, and the
 * mechanism used to look up and deserialize the associated object (the
 * referent), are implementation-specific.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation differs from {@link AbstractReference} in that the
 * referent object is referenced through a
 * <code>java.lang.ref.WeakReference</code>. Thus the garbage collector may
 * choose to discard the referent value, in which case the <code>get</code>
 * method will simply look it up again on demand.
