/**
 * <p>
 * Interface for reference classes used to isolate object references during
 * serialization.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Any subclass of <code>java.lang.ref.Reference</code> implements this
 * interface; thus applications can use this interface, but implement it using a
 * subclasses of <code>java.lang.ref.WeakReference</code> (for example).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The general problem this interface is intended to solve is to control and
 * reduce the scope of serialization of an object. In a typical application some
 * object A may need to refer to some other object B that has a large graph of
 * connected objects. Using Java's standard serialization mechanism, serializing
 * A also serializes B and all the objects it refers to. This set may be very
 * large, and further, it may be semantically incorrect to serialize the state
 * of B with A because the state of B may change independently of A.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A <code>PersistitReference</code> may be used to break the serialization
 * relationship of B to A. Instead of having a field of A directly containing an
 * instance of B, the field in A would hold a <code>PersistitReference</code>
 * that in turn refers to B. Implementations of PersistitReference are intended
 * to implement it in such a way that only a persistent object identifier for B
 * is stored in the serialized form of the <code>PersistitReference</code>
 * rather than a fully serialization of B. The <code>get</code> method is
 * intended to deserialize (if necessary) and return the object referred to be
 * that persistent identifier. {@link AbstractReference} provides such an
 * implementation.
 * </p>
