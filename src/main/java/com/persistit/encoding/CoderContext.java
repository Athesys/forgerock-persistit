/**
 * A marker interface for an application-specific object that may be passed to a
 * {@link KeyCoder} or {@link ValueCoder}. This object may be used to pass
 * application context information from the application to the coder instance.
 * The following methods accept a <code>CoderContext</code>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Key#append(Object, CoderContext)}</li>
 * <li>{@link Key#decode(Object, CoderContext)}</li>
 * <li>{@link Key#decodeDisplayable(boolean, Appendable, CoderContext)}</li>
 * <li>{@link Value#put(Object, CoderContext)}</li>
 * <li>{@link Value#get(Object, CoderContext)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * This interface has no behavior; it simply marks classes that are intended for
 * this purpose to enhance type safety. Note that <code>CoderContext</code>
 * extends <code>java.io.Serializable</code>, meaning that any object you
 * provide as a CoderContext must behave correctly when serialized and
 * deserialized.
