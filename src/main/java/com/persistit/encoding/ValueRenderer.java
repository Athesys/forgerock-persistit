 * A <code>ValueRenderer</code> can implement an application-level contract to

 * with many fields that refer to other objects. Deserializing and populating
 * all the fields of such a <code>Person</code> object might not be appropriate
 * in an area of the application that merely needs to display a list of names.
 * To avoid completely deserializing numerous <code>Person</code> objects, the
 * application could register a <code>ValueRenderer</code> implementation that
 * knows how to decode a serialized <code>Person</code> into a
 * <code>PersonListData</code> object. To do so it would {@link Value#get} the
 * desired interior fields of the encoded <code>Person</code> and
 * {@link Value#skip} the other fields.
