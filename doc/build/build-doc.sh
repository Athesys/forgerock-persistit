#
# Builds the Akiban Persistit doc set.  Currently this process is based on
# the Sphinx tool (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).
#
# Here are the steps:
# 1. Run a Java program SphinxDocPrep to prepare a text rst file.
#    Among other things, SphinxDocPrep fills in JavaDoc hyperlinks.
# 2. Run sphinx-build to generate html files.
# 3. Use fold and sed to specially prepare an extra plain text file
#    for the release notes.
#
# Run this script from the doc/build/ directory of the persistit source
# tree. This script writes all output into the ../../target/sphinx 
# directory.
